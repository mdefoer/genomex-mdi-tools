#optionFamilies: # similar to pipeline.yml if needed for families defined by the module
#condaFamilies: 

# TODO: make sure pipelines-framework handles action modules as a self-contained unit
# pipeline.yml should never override conda or options set by the pipeline, even from _global

# action modules should always resolve to their own suite's shared directory
# not the calling pipeline's in the case that the action module is external

# TODO: action modules should support containers independently of a pipeline?
# essentially, an action module is a single-action pipeline
# pipeline.yml _global should not apply to action modules, which must completely define themselves
