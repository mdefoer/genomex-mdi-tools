#optionFamilies: # similar to pipeline.yml if needed for families defined by the module
#condaFamilies: 

# TODO: make sure pipelines-framework handles action modules as a self-contained unit
# pipeline.yml should never override conda or options set by the module, even from _global
# DONE

# action modules should always resolve to their own suite's shared directory
# when looking for optionFamilies and condaFamilies
# not the calling pipeline's in the case that the action module is external
# PENDING
