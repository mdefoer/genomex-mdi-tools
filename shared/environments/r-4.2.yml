# current R program versions as of November 2022

# The packages contained in 'r-essentials' are not well documented.  
# The following are known to be present:
#   - jsonlite
#   - data.table

# To check whether a package is available in a conda environment, 
# activate it and run:
#   Rscript -e 'library(foo); message("package foo OK\n")'

# If the package is OK, add it to the documentation list above. If
# you get an error that R can't find the package, you
# need to add it to your pipeline's conda dependencies.
