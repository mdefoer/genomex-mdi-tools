These pages provide a detailed description of the **MDI tool suite template**, 
which you can use to create your own suite of Stage 1 Pipelines and Stage 2 Apps. 

- <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-suite-template>

## Quick Start

[**Click here**](https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-suite-template/generate) 
to create a new suite repository from this template.

>We recommend **NAME-mdi-tools** as the name of your 
repository, replacing 'NAME' with an informative name of your choosing, 
e.g., 'johndoelab'.

Open and edit the following files, using the instructions in comments
to find lines to edit to match your needs:

- _config.yml
- overview.md
- LICENSE (adjust the type, year, and licensee)
- README.md (delete the developer instructions, if desired)

Then copy and modify the '_template' pipeline or app, which provides a working 
boilerplate for all required tool code.
