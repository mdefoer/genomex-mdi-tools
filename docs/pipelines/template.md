## Template pipeline

Folder **pipelines/_template** has a working boilerplate for
a basic Stage 1 pipeline. 

Copy it to begin work on a new pipeline. At a minimum, you will
want to read and edit file 'pipeline.yml' and add code into
an action subfolder.

Create file **docs/pipelines/PIPELINE_NAME.md** to document your new pipeline.
Suggested sections to include would be an overview of its purpose,
prerequisites, etc.
