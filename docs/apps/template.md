## Template app

Folder **shiny/apps/_template** has a working boilerplate for
a basic Stage 2 app. 

Copy it to begin work on a new app. At a minimum, you will
want to read and edit files:

- config.yml
- overview.md

Create file **docs/apps/APP_NAME.md** to document your new app.
Suggested sections to include would be an overview of its purpose,
prerequisites, etc.
